# Language Translation

## Overview
In this project, I implmeneted a **Sequence to Sequence** model comprised a Recurrent Neural Netowrk (RNN) encoder and decoder, and Skip-gram word embedding layers to train on 18 MB of English and French text corpus with TensorFlow

## Result
The model reached a validation accuracy of 90% and can translate basic English to French.

## Future Work
Train the model on a larger corpus to further improve tranlation performance.
