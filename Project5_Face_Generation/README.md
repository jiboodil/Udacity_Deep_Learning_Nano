# Face Generation

## Overview
In this project, I built a deep **Generative Adversarial Convolutional Neural Network (GACNN)** with TensorFlow in Python to learn 1800 MB of celebrity image data from CelebA dataset. 

## Result
The model is capable of generating realistic face images in only 1 epoch of training with batch normalization.

## Further Work
The model can be further improved with more epoches and hyper parameter optimization. The GACNN can also be used to create training data for other machine learning models.
