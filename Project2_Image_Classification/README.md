# Image Classification

## Introduction

In this project, I use TensorFlow to build a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of 10 objects (airplanes, dogs, cats etc.) from CIFAR-10 dataset. I implemented key CNN elements including two convolutional layers with max pooling, and two fully connected layer with drop out to combat over-fitting. After fine-tuning hyper-parameters, the testing accuracy reached 56%, whereas random guessing only yielded about 10%
